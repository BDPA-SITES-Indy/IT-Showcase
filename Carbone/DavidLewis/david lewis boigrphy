My name is David Lewis and I am 13 years old. I was born in Carmel, Indiana on December 29th, 2006.
I have 2 parents and a sister. Some activities that I participate in are tennis and robotics.
My goal is to learn more about coding because, to me, that is a very useful skill to develop, since we are 
transitioning into a time where technology plays an impact in everyone's life.
