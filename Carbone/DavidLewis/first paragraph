First we can improve on the toxicity of car fuel in general.
We can do this by using a different fuel entirely. That would biofuel.
In the text it says “The appeal of FCEVs rest on their efficiency,
rapid filling times, and above all, emissions of only water and warm air.,”.
This is an improvement on the toxicity because it only emits water and warm air
which isn't dangerous to breath in.
